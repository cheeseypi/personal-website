	<h1>McKinsey NSM</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>The Network State Master for McKinsey &amp; Company. Allows for a single point of contact to get information about all intranet network devices. Has both a GUI and an API portion, both initially developed by me in Summer 2017 up to a Minimum Viable Product, allowing for users to dynamically receive up-to-date network information within programs or on the website. I have continued working on it in my Spring 2018 internship there, and it is now in production use.</p>
